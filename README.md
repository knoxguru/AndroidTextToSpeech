#Intro

This is an Android App that allows a user to control a service that will listen for incoming text messages. If you get a text an Activity is launched. From the activity you can press either volume up or down or the button on the screen to be read the text message aloud. Should work over bluetooth but I haven't tested that.

A Demo of this app can be found on the play store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.knoxguru.texttospeech
